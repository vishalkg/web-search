# Multi-Engine Search Result Ranking Optimization Strategy

## Current State Analysis

### Issues Identified
- **Engine tracking attribution failure** - results not properly attributed to source engines
- **Naive ranking**: Simple rank-based deduplication favors first result
- **No diversity guarantee**: May miss good results from other engines
- **LLM gets suboptimal choices**: Current system doesn't optimize for LLM selection

### Current Algorithm
```python
def deduplicate_results(all_results, num_results):
    url_to_best = {}
    for result in all_results:
        url = result["url"]
        rank = result.get("rank", 999)
        if url not in url_to_best or rank < url_to_best[url]["rank"]:
            url_to_best[url] = result
    return sorted(list(url_to_best.values()), key=lambda x: x.get("rank", 999))[:num_results]
```

**Problems**: Only considers individual engine ranking, ignores engine expertise, no diversity guarantee.

## Use Case Clarification

**Goal**: Provide best candidate pool to LLM for second-level selection
- LLM receives ~15 results (5 from each engine)
- LLM decides which pages to fetch for content
- We need to maximize quality and diversity of choices

**This is federated search, not hybrid search** - different problem requiring different solution.

## Proposed Solution: Quality-First with Diversity

### Why Not RRF?
RRF is designed for hybrid search (combining different query types on same corpus). Our use case is federated search (same query across different engines). We want to:
1. **Trust each engine's expertise** - their top 5 are their best judgment
2. **Guarantee diversity** - ensure LLM gets options from all engines
3. **Preserve provenance** - LLM knows which engine found what

### Algorithm: Token-Optimized Quality Selection

**Process Flow**:
1. Take top 4 results from each engine (12 total)
2. Deduplicate by URL (typically reduces to 8-10 unique)
3. Rank by original engine position
4. Return top 10 with direct source attribution

```python
def create_llm_optimized_pool(ddg_results, bing_results, startpage_results):
    # Collect candidates with engine attribution
    candidates = []
    for i, result in enumerate(ddg_results[:4]):
        candidates.append({**result, "engine": "duckduckgo", "rank": i+1})
    for i, result in enumerate(bing_results[:4]):
        candidates.append({**result, "engine": "bing", "rank": i+1})
    for i, result in enumerate(startpage_results[:4]):
        candidates.append({**result, "engine": "startpage", "rank": i+1})

    # Deduplicate - keep best ranked version
    unique_results = deduplicate_keep_best_rank(candidates)

    # Rank by original engine position (trust engine expertise)
    ranked_results = sorted(unique_results, key=lambda x: x["rank"])[:10]

    # Add direct source attribution to each result
    clean_results = []
    for result in ranked_results:
        clean_result = {k: v for k, v in result.items() if k not in ["rank"]}
        clean_result["source"] = result["engine"]
        clean_results.append(clean_result)

    return clean_results

def deduplicate_keep_best_rank(candidates):
    seen = {}
    for candidate in candidates:
        url = candidate["url"]
        if url not in seen or candidate["rank"] < seen[url]["rank"]:
            seen[url] = candidate
    return list(seen.values())
```

### Response Format Optimization

**LLM receives clean format with direct attribution**:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Complete Python Machine Learning Tutorial",
      "url": "https://example.com/ml-tutorial",
      "snippet": "Learn machine learning with Python from basics...",
      "source": "duckduckgo"
    },
    {
      "title": "Scikit-learn Documentation",
      "url": "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial",
      "snippet": "Official scikit-learn tutorials covering...",
      "source": "bing"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Benefits**: Self-contained attribution, LLM-friendly, no index mapping needed

## Algorithm Comparison

| Method | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **Current Simple** | Fast | Biased, no diversity | None - should replace |
| **RRF** | Good for hybrid search | Wrong problem type | Different query types on same corpus |
| **Quality-First** | Trusts engines, guarantees diversity | May have duplicates | **Our use case** |

## Implementation Details

### Fix Tracking System
```python
# In format_search_response(), ensure proper attribution
ddg_with_engine = [{"source_engine": "ddg", **result} for result in ddg_results]
bing_with_engine = [{"source_engine": "bing", **result} for result in bing_results]
startpage_with_engine = [{"source_engine": "startpage", **result} for result in startpage_results]
```

### Engine Failure Handling
```python
def safe_get_top_results(results, count=5):
    """Safely get top N results, handling empty/failed engines."""
    return results[:count] if results else []
```
